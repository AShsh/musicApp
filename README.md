# Test Task

Given is a basic vuejs construct with 2 components (Songs, Playlists). You may use it, change it as you like or create an own vuejs app by yourself.

**App Requirements and Behaviour:**
* The app consists of songs and playlists
* A user must be able to create multiple playlists and freely assign songs
* A playlist management function must exist: see existing playlists, delete/add songs to existing playlists, delete/create playlists
* When new song gets added to a playlist a message comes up that says "song X added to playlist Y"
* Playlists must be stored locally but not in cookies to be available after browser reload
* The GUI must be responsive for desktop and mobile devices

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
